My name is Emmanuel Morales, and I'm a Front-End Developer at [Headspring](http://www.headspring.com/) in Dallas, TX.

I'm a high‐performing, strategic‐thinking professional with more than 8+ years of experience designing solutions for complex web-based business applications.  Contributed to all levels of the development cycle, from obtaining requirements, documenting, architecture, and delivering a quality approved solution.  Experienced in modular design techniques, for creating flexible and reusable architectures.  Collaborated with development teams using Agile/Scrum and Waterfall software methodologies. Developed responsive cross-platform applications using latest technologies such as HTML5, JavaScript, ReactJS, Redux, AngularJS, jQuery, KendoUI, jQueryUI, MVC, WebAPI, Entity Framework, among others.

Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my family and wife, eating good food, drinking a lot of coffee, watching TV series and working with many personal challenges (including but not limited to Blogging, Communication, Legacy, Finance, Leadership, etc).
