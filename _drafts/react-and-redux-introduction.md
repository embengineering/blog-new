How can we get started with React and Redux, simple and in few steps?
<!--more-->

>*“There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. The first method is far more difficult.” -C.A.R. Hoare (British computer scientist, winner of the 1980 Turing Award)*

## How to get started?

There are many "starting" projects to help you get started with these technologies.  It's worth it to mention that I was inspired from few of them.  However, many were too much complicated or lack on the technologies I was aiming to use.

Before starting, I would like to mention a basic list of main technologies I considered in my project. The list can be longer if I get into details. Let's expand this topic in a separate post. For now this is the core of the project.

1. [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) (Module bundler)
2. [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) (Mature CSS extension language)
3. [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) (A JavaScript library for building user interfaces)
4. [Google Material Design](https://getmdl.io/) (The official Material Design library that doesn't rely on JavaScript frameworks)
5. [React Hot Loader](http://gaearon.github.io/react-hot-loader/) (Tweak React components in real time)
6. [Redux Dev Tools](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools) (A live-editing time travel environment for Redux)

Building front-end these days have a huge dependency on Node and NPM, let's make sure we have them install and configured:

1. Download [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) for the desired environment
2. Install (restarting the computer sometimes is necessary)
3. Verify the installation by using `node -v` and `npm -v`

To get started let's start with these steps:

1. Clone the following repository [https://github.com/embengineering/react-redux-starting-kit.git](https://github.com/embengineering/react-redux-starting-kit.git)
2. Switch to directory `cd react-redux-starting-kit`
3. Install NPM dependencies `npm install`
4. Run in development mode `npm run watch`
